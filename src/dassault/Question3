Interviewer Asked 
what if ABC+ABC = CCC;
then what are A, B and C ?

manoj answer:
ABC+ABC = CCC
all are positive

AB0 +AB0 = 000
2AB0 = 000

BUt i think interview said all three are different

ABC+ABC+ABC=CCC, then what is the value of "ABC"?

SOLUTION:
Now, as per the question, the alphabets “ABC” is a 3 digit number. Then, each one of them, i.e. A,B,c are 3 digits.

So, here, the sum of 3 C’s in the unit’s place again results in C. This is possible only when “C” is either 5 or 0. But the, if you choose 0 then each of the digit accounts to zero. That means A,B,C is 0.(not preety much expected tough :p)

Case2: Only other no. C can be 5. Thus, A,B must be,

AB5+AB5+AB5=555,

AB5=555/3=185.
