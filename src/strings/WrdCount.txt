Three years ago, we purchased a commercial lot for our commercial space rental business. We applied for a bank loan. Then the construction began. It was my wish that our main tenant would be a bank since I know that banks are reliable and pay good rent and in return, the rental fee would pay off the loan. I wrote what I wanted in my prayer book.

Bank ‘P’ went to the site and they were interested however their offer was not very good. I was praying for a specific bank, Bank ‘B’. I had been hearing news that they were looking for a site in our place. I contacted them and sent them my intent offer. I even called the Area Manager and she said they did have plans for a site but it was not a priority. So I was left shaken and fearful. Where was I going to get the money to pay off our monthly amortization? After that call, I did not hear from them anymore.

I let go of Bank B and tried contacting other interested banks. To my surprise when I was not expecting it all, the Vice President of Bank B together with the Area Manager I spoke with earlier, visited my place. The Vice President was interested in the location and his words were ‘I like the location and a contract has been prepared’. Their offer was good enough to pay off our monthly amortization. And just as I had wished for, it would do so in 10 years! God and the Universe and Bank B gave me a 10 year-lease contract! Thank you!

The LOA is about setting your heart’s desire and then letting it go. Trust that your heart’s desire will be given to you in the most unexpected way and at the most perfect time.  Truly, the key is to let go!. Don’t dwell on it too much. The more you chase it, the more it eludes you.

By the way, my first entry here is Europe And Our Lady Of Lourdes.
